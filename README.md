A litte note on git. If you start your project locally and then create a remote repo on GitHub with a README.md file for example, then you must 'fetch' and 'merge' the remote copy to the local branch.

This can me done by using the single `git pull origin main` command where 'origin' is the name of your remote repo and 'main' is the name of the (remote) branch.
